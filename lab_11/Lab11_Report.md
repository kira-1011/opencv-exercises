## What We Did
We learned about modern real-time object detection using advanced deep learning models:
- **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once) - State-of-the-art detection
- **Model Comparison** - Different YOLO versions  
- **FPS Benchmarking** - Performance testing
- **Custom Training** - How to train on your own data
- **OpenCV DNN** - Deployment without external dependencies

## Real-Time Detection Methods

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| YOLOv8n | Fastest | Good | Mobile devices, embedded |
| YOLOv8s | Balanced | Better | General applications |
| YOLOv8m | Slower | Best | High accuracy requirements |

## What We Implemented

### 1. Basic YOLOv8 Detection
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
results = model.predict(source=frame, show=True, conf=0.5)
```
- Real-time webcam object detection
- Automatic bounding boxes and labels
- 80 COCO classes (person, car, cat, etc.)

### 2. Performance Comparison
- Tested YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m
- Measured inference time and detection count
- Speed vs accuracy trade-offs

### 3. FPS Benchmarking  
- Live performance measurement
- Real-time FPS display
- Hardware capability testing

### 4. OpenCV DNN Integration
- Hardware-independent deployment
- ONNX model format support
- No external dependencies needed
